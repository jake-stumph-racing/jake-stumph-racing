- 👋 Hi, I’m @jake-stumph-racing
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (duh), and all manner of things automotive. 
On any given weekend you can find me at the track in either my Honda, setting fast lap times, or my BMW, going drifting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, and will begin applying for jobs January 1, 2022.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! I have knowledge of basic front end langauges (JS, CSS, HTML), and Java, of course. Looking to learn.
- 📫 How to reach me: stumph.jake@gmail.com !
